# Testbench

`make` is used (in Tiff) to generate `test.c` and `vm.c` from templates.
For example:

```
make ../templates/app.c ../testbench/vm.c
200 make ../templates/test_main.c ../testbench/test.c
```

The test vectors are generated by Tiff stepping through its VM and noting changes.
In this example, "Hello World", the VM prints most of Hello World but ends before BYE executes.
That would abort testbench generation (oops).

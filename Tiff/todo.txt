
Add a simple version of tiff.f (maybe testbench.f) that has some test code.
   Compile to ROM location 0 instructions that exercise one opcode at a time until
   all of them have been hit at least once. 

Add a QUIT loop.

Tiff's version of literal uses long literals for IMM>1FFFFFF, should be 3FFFFFF.

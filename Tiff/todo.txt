
Add a simple version of tiff.f (maybe testbench.f) that has some test code.
   Compile to ROM location 0 instructions that exercise one opcode at a time until
   all of them have been hit at least once. 

Add SPI bootloader that waits for hex file for 1 second then attempts boot.
Note: Underlying system should handle XON/XOFF and serial buffering.

Add a QUIT loop.

Change Tiff to not use !AS for writing to "SPI flash", etc. Use vmUser function 5.


Add a simple version of tiff.f (maybe testbench.f) that has some test code.
   Compile to ROM location 0 instructions that exercise one opcode at a time until
   all of them have been hit at least once. 

Add C version of testbench:
   Using the 'expected' table, step the VM and look at expected values.
   If an error occurs, display the line number it occurred at, the offending registers,
   and the expected and actual values. Stop after the first error.

Add DO LOOP, FOR NEXT, etc.
Add SPI bootloader that waits for hex file for 1 second then attempts boot.
Note: Underlying system should handle XON/XOFF and serial buffering.
Add CREATE DOES>

Add a QUIT loop.

Change Tiff to not use !AS for writing to "SPI flash", etc. Use vmUser function 5.

# Hello World Demo

The demo program runs Tiff's VM out of an internal ROM (in vm.c) compiled by Tiff.
It simply prints "Hello World" to the console.

The vm.c file was generated by running tiff in the `/forth` folder, which inserted
the internal ROM declaration (big table).

The program size is 26 kB when compiled (statically linked) as a Code::Blocks console
application. Since the ROM is under 2K bytes, most of that is C scaffolding.
The VM could be implemented in MASM if you wanted to get crazy about code size,
but this demonstrates that you can have small compiled Forth apps.
The idea is to embedded Forth apps in C apps to enable interactive testing.

An interesting experiment would be to specify the ROM file from the command line.
That way, the "Hello World" app would be more like 2KB (it has some library bloat)
and the same puny (26KB) executable would host arbitrary apps.

The vm.c file is generated by expanding macros in a template.
In `tiff.f`, `make ../templates/template.c ../demo/vm.c` creates a VM that's mostly
contained in one file.

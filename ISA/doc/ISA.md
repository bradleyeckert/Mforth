
The MachineForth paradigm, discovered by the late Jeff Fox, is a method for
programming Forth stack machines in the most direct way possible, by making
machine opcodes a part of the high level language. The programmer is writing
to an actual machine rather than a virtual one. It’s a different way of programming.
With the right ISA, optimizations are minimal so this virtualization is unnecessary.
An ISA for a dialect of MachineForth is presented.
